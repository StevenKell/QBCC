        <strong>Agenda:</strong> <br><br>
        <strong>First talk:</strong> <br>
        Supercharging Real-time Applications with Vector and Graph<br>
        Speaker: Art Anderson, Sr Dev Experience Engineer (Aerospike)<br>
        Embark on a journey connecting key-value, vector, and graph to build real-world applications showcasing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using semantic search along with recommendation engines, user profile stores, and more. Unlock the full potential of your real-time applications with multi-model databases and see how Python pulls this all together.<br></p>
        
        <p><strong>Second talk:</strong> <br>New Machine Learning Paradigm with DSPy: No Prompt Engineering Required<br>
        Speaker: Ilia Zlobin, Systems Architect<br>
        Prompt engineering has some limitations in that you have to tailor it to a particular use case and then adjust and support it as your application continues to evolve. With DSPy, you look at the problem from the traditional machine learning perspective where you operate with datasets orchestration, evaluation metrics and hyper-parameters tuning to improve performance on the task. DSPy gives you exactly that but for LLMs and with much lower requirements in terms of training data size, hardware resources needed. With a slight effort you could gain a great boost in performance and could seamlessly continue increasing your application complexity.<br></p>
